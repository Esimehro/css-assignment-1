      <h3>About me and my love for Technology.</h3>
      <p>My name is Lois Omodibo. My love for Technology stems from the fact that <b>Technology</b> has the ability to
          impact lives at a level and scale that has never been realized in the history of mankind. <i>The idea that
            something I create can impact someone across the world now, or in the future is what drives my passion for
            Technology</i>. I find technology to be a rewarding career that allows me to learn new skills every day. I'm
          interested in a career in <b>Technology</b> because I want to use my skills and knowledge to make other
          people's jobs easier and more productive. Efficiency is huge to me, and I have a passion for finding new and
          more productive ways to reach goals.

        the list tags <i>(Ordered and Unordered list)</i> and also the paragraph tag . I learnt how to build a table
        using hmtl tags, I also learnt how to create a card using html tags and html forms too. I have been able to
        build a card, simple sign up forms and contact forms with my new knowledge of html and as well, push my work
        to github.
      </p>

      <h5>CSS:</h5>
      <p>I know that websites are styled and beautified using css. There are three methods of styling
        css, which are; in-line styling, Internal css styling, Linking an externnal css file. I learnt about css
        selectors - <i>element selector, universal selsector, descendant selector, attribute selector, class
        selector, and ID selector.</i> I learnt about specificity, how it affects styling in css aand how to resolve
        styling
        conflicts in css. I learnt about the css box
        model, i know the difference between content box and border box. I know about margin, padding, content,
        border. I learnt about css properties and values and also css properties such as; font-size, margin,
        max-height, max-width, padding, border, color, background color etc. With my knowledge of css, i was able to
        create a sticky board with sticky notes in it and also style the sign up form i built with html.
      </p>

      <h3>Importance of css</h3>
      <p><b>Css</b> helps us to <i>style</i> our websites and make them pleasing to the user which in turn
        creates great user experience. <b>Css</b> controls the page layout, colors and the overall visual aspect of
        the
        website.

      <h3>Difference between Padding, Margin and Borders</h3>
      <h5><i>Padding:</i></h5>
      <p> This is used to create space for the content within a container.</p>
      <h5><i>Margin:</i></h5>
      <p>This is used to create space outside of a container or between containers. Margins also specify
        space around an element's border.
      </p>
      <h5><i>Borders:</i></h5>
      <p>This allows you specify the width, style and color for an element. Border is the shorthand property for
        border-style, border-color, and borther width. It saves time because you can use a single css file on multiple
        html pages.
